+ This is a Multi-factors linear strategy which combines 5 factors to predict stock returns.
+ Portfolio is rebalanced on a daily basis, and the strategy will choose 10 stocks with the highest predicted returns everyday. Each stocks are equally weighted.
+ Strategy performances under different transaction fees are tested.
+ Using the equally weighted all stocks strategy as the benchmark, I compare the performance of the strategy and the benchmark. Results show that the strategy generates a higher total return, but it also leads to a higher volatility and max drawdown.
+ The multi-factor model is not stable enough, and there's much room for improvement. And changing the strategy into a weekly-rebalanced one is also worth a try.
